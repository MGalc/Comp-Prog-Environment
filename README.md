## Competitive Programming Configurations

This is just my personal configurations for my competitive programming environment.

At the time of writing this the main software I use is:

#### Vim
- Plugins I use are shown within the .vimrc config file.

#### Tmux
- Essentially allows multiple terminals to be controlled and viewed from a single terminal (Terminal Multiplexer).

#### Tmuxinator
- Creates a fast and easy way of creating a template for Tmux.
- Can load up a template with a single terminal command, rather than arranging the Tmux terminals manually.

#### YouCompleteMe
- A code-completion engine for Vim (I use it for C++).
- Needs to be built manually and added to Vim plugins (unlike other plugins listed in .vimrc).
